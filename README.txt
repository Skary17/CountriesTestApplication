### REST API CountryTestApplication


## Description of Approach and Implementation

In this project, a REST API was built to consume data from the REST Countries API, process this data, and provide specific endpoints to return the processed results. The API was developed using ASP.NET Core with the following endpoints:

- `GET /api/countries`: Retrieves a list of countries with pagination, filtering, searching, and sorting capabilities.
- `GET /api/countries/{code}`: Retrieves details for a specific country by its code.
- `GET /api/regions`: Retrieves a list of regions and the countries within each region.
- `GET /api/languages`: Retrieves a list of languages spoken and the countries where they are spoken.

To ensure efficiency and performance, caching was implemented using `IMemoryCache`, and data fetching was handled with the RestSharp library. Swagger UI was integrated for documentation and testing.

### Highlight Something Interesting or Significant

One interesting aspect of this project was the use of caching to optimize performance. By caching the responses from the REST Countries API, the number of external API calls was significantly reduced, which improved the overall responsiveness and efficiency of the application. Additionally, handling different filtering, searching, and sorting options in a clean and maintainable way was an interesting challenge that showcased skills in LINQ and functional programming in C#.

### What Is Most Pleased or Proud Of

The overall architecture and the clean separation of concerns in the project are particularly pleasing. The use of dependency injection, well-defined service interfaces, and caching mechanisms resulted in a robust and maintainable codebase.

### Features or Improvements to Add Given More Time

Given more time, the following features and improvements would be added:

1. **Unit Testing**: Implement comprehensive unit tests to ensure the reliability and correctness of the API functionality.
2. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Implement more granular error handling and logging to provide better insights into issues and improve the resilience of the API.
3. **Rate Limiting**: Introduce rate limiting to prevent abuse of the API and ensure fair usage among all users.
4. **Asynchronous Data Fetching**: Optimize data fetching with asynchronous and parallel processing to further improve performance.
5. **Internationalization Support**: Extend the API to support multiple languages and provide localized responses.
6. **Deployment Automation**: Implement CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment to streamline the development workflow.

These enhancements would further improve the usability, performance, and reliability of the API, making it more robust and feature-rich.
